Look, I practically did nothing but just replace Wenda with my OC. Other than that, all sounds, sprites, and code is made by NyankoBfLmao.

## Hey read this shit!
Let me be clear, I may like Sprunki, but that doesn't mean I like the fandom. I do not condone any hateful behavior made towards the original creator, or anything he has explictly told others not to do. If it is in his intrest for me to take down this mod, I will do so.
